The problem of business-IT alignment is a relevant problem for all types of organizations, regardless of whether they are centralized or decentralized. Solving it allows all components of an enterprise to operate together in a collaborative manner for the purpose of maximizing overall benefit to the enterprise. Enterprise Architecture frameworks seek to outline a formal way in which to solve this problem. This thesis argues, however, that modern EA frameworks are designed for centralized organizations, and as such, might not be suitable for application in decentralized organizations. As modern organizations are becoming increasingly more decentralized, this suitability of modern EA frameworks for decentralization is becoming increasingly relevant. Consequently, this thesis addresses the problem of creating a suitable EA for decentralized organizations.

An important part of this thesis project is to analyze the suitability of existing EA frameworks for decentralization. Therefore, the problem will be fully explicated in the results chapter, Section \ref{sec:problem}.
