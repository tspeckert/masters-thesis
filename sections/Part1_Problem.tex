The problem of business-IT alignment is a relevant problem for all types of organizations, regardless of whether they have a centralized or decentralized structure. Solving it allows all components of an enterprise to operate together in a collaborative manner for the purpose of maximizing overall benefit to the enterprise. Enterprise Architecture frameworks outline a formal way in which to solve this problem. This thesis argues, however, that modern EA frameworks are primarily supportive of centralized organizations, and as such, have some shortcomings when applied in decentralized organizations. As modern organizations are becoming increasingly more decentralized, this suitability of modern EA frameworks for decentralization is becoming increasingly relevant. Consequently, this thesis addresses the problem of creating a suitable EA for decentralized organizations.

An important part of this thesis project is to analyze the suitability of existing EA frameworks for decentralization. Therefore, the problem will be fully explicated--including a precise definition, problem motivation, and root cause analysis--in the results chapter, Section \ref{sec:problem}.
