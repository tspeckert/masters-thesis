The problem of how to organize an entire organization is a relevant problem for all types of enterprises, regardless of whether they are centralized or decentralized. Enterprise Architecture methodologies and frameworks seek to outline a formal way in which to solve this problem. This thesis argues, however, that modern EA frameworks are designed for centralized enterprises, and are not an adequate solution for decentralized enterprises. As modern enterprises are becoming increasingly more decentralized, this shortcoming of modern EA frameworks is an increasingly important problem. Consequently, this thesis addresses the problem of creating a suitable EA for decentralized enterprises.
