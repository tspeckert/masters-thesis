\section{Problem}
Enterprises always have the problem of how to have their architecture (i.e. its structure, systems and processes) integrated with their goals, strategies and visions. Enterprise Architecture methodologies and frameworks seek to outline a formal way in which to solve this problem. This thesis argues that these modern EA frameworks and methods are meant for centralized enterprise environments. Modern enterprises do not necessarily operate in this centralized manner; it is becoming increasingly more common for enterprises to operate in a more decentralized manner. This can be seen.... (EXAMPLES, OR CITATIONS).  Decentralized enterprises, like centralized enterprises, have the problem of integration between architecture and goals, strategies and visions.  However, the application of current EA frameworks is not a suitable solution, as they are meant for centralized enterprises. This thesis addresses this problem of creating a suitable EA for decentralized enterprises.
