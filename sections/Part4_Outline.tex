%6.4 Guidelines for Outline Artefact and Define Requirements
%- Specify what artefact to build! Specify the artefact type (construct,
%model, method, instantiation) and its general characteristics.
%Formulate each requirement clearly! Describe each requirement
%in a precise, concise and easily understandable way.
%
%- justify each requirement! For each requirement, explain why
%it is needed and relate it to the problem.
%Be realistic but also original! Ensure that it is realistic to develop
%an artefact fulfilling the requirements but also try to be
%original.
%
%- Specify the sources of the requirements! Describe the literature
%and the stakeholders that have contributed to defining
%the requirements.
%
%Describe how you have defined the requirements! Explain
%what you have done to define the requirements, in particular
%how you have reviewed the stakeholders and research literature.

\subsubsection*{Outline Artifact}

As identified in Section \ref{sec:exproblem}, an important property of a decentralized business environment that needs to be supported by EA is horizontal coordination. However, current EA frameworks primarily support vertical coordination in their governance styles, as identified in Section \ref{sec:exproblem} and Table \ref{table:summary}. Consequently, a possible solution to the problem of decentralization in EA could be \textit{model} of an EA governance framework supporting decentralization. 

%maybe not model, maybe something else



%TODO since we're deciding on artifact here, need to reflect on that in method (e.g. selecting based on case study)



%For example, if IT systems
%need to be integrated to make a process more efficient, a solution
%can be a method for integrating IT systems, a model of an integration
%architecture, or an instantiation in the form of an integration tool.
%When the artefact type has been chosen, the artefact is to be described
%on an overview level.

%
%construct, a model, a method or an instantiation.
%
%Methods express prescriptive knowledge by defining guidelines
%and processes for how to solve problems and achieve goals. In particular,
%they can prescribe how to create artefacts. Methods can be
%highly formalized like algorithms, but they can also be informal such
%as rules of thumb or best practices. Some examples are methods for
%database design, change management initiatives, or web service development.
%
%Models are used to depict or represent other objects. A model can
%represent an existing situation, which can be used for describing and
%analyzing problem situations. Such a descriptive model may work as a
%pedagogical tool for representing a current situation and explaining
%why it is challenging. However, models can also be used to describe
%potential solutions to practical problems, e.g. a drawing for a new
%type of vehicle or a proposal for an architecture of a mobile operating
%system. Such prescriptive models work as descriptions of possible
%future solutions and help to build artefacts that can solve practical
%problems. There are also predictive models that can be used to forecast
%the behavior of objects and systems. Thus, models can express
%descriptive as well as predictive and prescriptive knowledge. In design
%science, the focus is on prescriptive models. Typical examples
%are business process models, systems architectures, domain ontologies,
%and user models.



\subsubsection*{Define Requirements}

The requirements for the artifact are outlined in Table \ref{table:requirements}.

\subsubsection*{Define Requirements}

In addition to the requirements in Table \ref{table:requirements}, the following additional requirements for the case are:
\begin{itemize}


\item Supportive of legal directives/decision rights that remain centralized

\item Supportive of centralized budgeting (I dunno)

\item Supportive of decentralized components (research groups, PHD students)
 

\item Supportive quality check system (though SU doesn't really use it...)

 
\item SU IT and DSV IT being separate, but still working together (eg. domain, DIVA/Daisy)

\item IT projects run by IT (sometimes approval from higher up for expensive ones)

\item The EA framework must support independent IT at DSV and at SU as well as their collaboration

\item Supportive of centres

\item Board (or replace?)

\item Advisory group

\item Performance measures

\item Research projects are self-managed (some economic controls exist)

\item Administrative systems (eg. HR and budget) for whole University are managed by Board

\item ROI not currently done

\item DSV does things because they think they are are interesting (PROTECT THIS)

\item Cooperation with outside institutions managed by the department  itself, no SU involvement

\item Current change structure for studies (come from anywhere -> Director investigates feasibility -> group (made up of relevant ppl) sets up plan) (For bologna, need for change was decided by LAW, but how to make the changes was done collaboratively by profs)

\item New programs require approval from faculty

\item Evaluation is generally informal, except for state level requirements

\item Funding for courses based around enrollment 

\item DSV pays for central systems but does not have to actually use them

\end{itemize}
