The results are presented in a manner that follows the application of the design science approach chosen for this thesis work. Each section corresponds to a design science activity (Explicate Problem, Outline Artifact and Define Requirements, Design and Develop Artifact, Demonstrate Artifact, and Evaluate Artifact). Each section is further divided into iterations, corresponding to the iterations outlined in Section~\ref{subsection:research_activities} and then into sub-activities, corresponding to the design-science sub-activities that were performed.
