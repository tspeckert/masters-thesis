\section{Choice of Research Method}

Empirical research "aims at describing, explaining and predicting the world"~\cite{johannessonPerjons2012}. In comparison, design research additionally wants to improve upon the world through the development of artifacts. This thesis project is interested in improving on EA by through the development of an EA frameowrk that is suitable for decentralized organizations. As a result, a design research approach, specifically design science, will be utilized. The remainder of this section seeks to further demonstrate the suitability of design science and outline the specific research strategies and methods chosen. 

\subsection{Design Science and its Relevance to this Thesis Work}

Design science is concerned with the development and application of \textit{artifacts} aimed at solving some practical problem~\cite{hevner2004,johannessonPerjons2012} in a manner that is of general interest~\cite{johannessonPerjons2012}. 

In order to be relevant, Design Science must exist in some context. Johannesson and Perjons~\cite{johannessonPerjons2012} define a generic context for design science in terms of people, practices and problems. A practice is a set of related activities performed regularly by people. In the performance of a practice, people encounter practical problems. Two general kinds of problems exist; one where the current state of affairs problematic and the desirable state is neutral, and a second where the current state is neutral and the desirable state is a big, surprising improvement. The artifacts created through design science can be used by people to solve these practical problems. These concepts are easily related to this thesis work: Enterprise Architecture is a practice with a problem of the first type.  The current state of EA is problematic when applied to decentralized organizations. This thesis argues that the existing artifacts (i.e. EA frameworks) are insufficient these types of organizations, and consequently, new artifacts (or a revision to the existing ones) need to be developed in order to solve this problem.

According to Johannesson and Perjons~\cite{johannessonPerjons2012}, artifacts themselves have an ``inner construction'', exist in an environment, and have a function. The inner construction refers to the inner components of the artifact and the relations between them. The environment refers to the artifacts practice, the people using it, and anything else in its surrounds that have an affect on it. Lastly, the function of an artifact is the result of using it in its practice. This definition of an artifact also relates well to this thesis work: the inner construction of our artifact (an EA framework for decentralized organizations) is, at a high level, composed of an EA method, EA description, and EA engine. The relations for these components are outlined in figure~\ref{TODO_IRINAS_DIAGRAM}. The environment of our artifact includes the practice of EA and all affected components of the decentralized organization using it, such as involved stakeholders and implementers. The function of our artifact is, on a high level, to bring the benefits of traditional EA to decentralized organizations (e.g. business-IT alignment).


There exist four different types of artifacts: constructs, models, methods, and instantiations~\cite{hevner2004,johannessonPerjons2012}. Enterprise architecture is concerned with the first three of those types: constructs, models and methods. Constructs are ways to describe some phenomenon. They give a common language for talking about something, but do not make any assertions about reality. For example, the EA description phase of an EA framework provides a common taxonomy for the different parts of an organization covered by EA. Models represent other objects. EA makes use of descriptive models and prescriptive models~\cite{johannessonPerjons2012}. Descriptive models are used to represent a current situation and its challenges, such the "as-is" architecture from the EA description phase. Prescriptive models represent potential future solutions, such as the "to-be" architecture, also from the EA description phase. Methods define "guidelines and processes for how to solve problems and achieve goals"~\cite{johannessonPerjons2012}. The EA method and EA engine phases are primarily methods, the former to construct the EA description, the latter to ensure its proper use throughout its lifecycle. 

\subsection{A Design Science Method Framework}
\label{sec:framework}

Having established the relevance of design science to this thesis project, this thesis will therefore follow the framework for a design science method presented by Johannesson and Perjons in ~\cite{johannessonPerjons2012}. This method is composed of five activities with input-output relationships: Explicate Problem, Outline Artifact and Define Requirements, Design and Develop Artifact, and Evaluate Artifact. Each activity has an output which serves as an input to the next activity (e.g. an explicated problem is the input to the Outline Artifact and Define Requirements phase). These activities are carried out in an iterative manner, meaning that the practitioner will move back and forth between them as opposed to working in a sequential manner. 

The Explicate Problem activity is concerned with outlining the problem addressed by the research work in detail. To this end, the problem's significance needs to be clearly stated and its underlying causes can be possibly identified and analyzed. The output of this phase an explicated problem. 

The Outline Artifact and Define Requirements activity is where the explicated problem is transformed into the requirements for a solution to said problem. The output of this phase is the set of requirements for the artifact. 

The Design and Develop Artifact activity is where the artifact itself is built based on the requirements for the artifact. The output of this phase is the artifact itself.

The Demonstrate Artifact activity takes the developed artifact and implements it in either a real or illustrative case in order to demonstrate its viability. The output of this phase is the demonstrated artifact. 

The Evaluate Artifact activity is to demonstrate the artifact's fulfillment of the requirements and the degree to which it solves the problem. The output here is an evaluated artifact. 

\subsection{Choice of Research Strategy}

Alternative strategies exist for undertaking research in the field of design science. A number of common strategies will be briefly outlined in order to discuss their suitability for this thesis. 

Surveys aim to take a comprehensive look at something by gathering data from a large number of different sources. This data is then analyzed in some manner. Surveys offer a wide view~\cite{denscombe2010good,johannessonPerjons2012}, and as such, are not well suited for a depth view of something. This does not fit in with this project which takes an in-depth look at EA frameworks. 

Experiments employ a controlled and artificial environment in order to isolate a small number of specific factors to study them in detail. The effects of manipulating variables in the environment needs to be precisely measured~\cite{denscombe2010good}. This poses a problem for EA as organizations are highly complex entities where it would be exceptionally difficult to exert precise control and precisely measure the effects. For this reason, experiments are not a suitable strategy for this project. 

In action research, the researcher is an active participant in affecting the environment they are researching. Here, the research is done as part of the practice, as opposed to it being a separate activity~\cite{denscombe2010good}. This could be a highly effective strategy for this thesis topic as it would allow the researcher to experience the problems of decentralization first-hand. Furthermore, action research is a cyclical process, meaning the researcher could repeatedly try out different solutions and evaluate their effects in order to come to a good solution. This would allow for a researcher in a decentralized organization the flexibility to find a solution that works. Despite this fit to the thesis topic, the practical issue of finding a decentralized organization that is willing to go through this process is a significant one. As a result, action research is not used in this project. 

Ethnography is similar to action research in that the researcher becomes a member of the environment being researched. The difference lies in that they are there to integrate themselves into it, rather than affect change~\cite{denscombe2010good}. This could be an applicable research strategy for understanding problems from the perspective of stakeholders, however finding a decentralized organization with some sort of EA (or at least an interest in it) is quite the challenge in itself. Additionally, ethnography requires a large time investment in order to integrate adequately into the environment of study, which is not feasible for a Master's project. For these reasons, ethnography is not used in this project. 

Case studies take an in depth view of a single instance of the practice where the problem of interest exists. Case studies are ideal when "a researcher wants to investigate an issue in depth and provide an explanation that can cope with the complexity and subtlety of real life situations"~\cite{denscombe2010good}. This project is interested in an in depth view of the problem of suitability of EA for decentralized organizations and decentralized organizations are real life entities that are highly complex. Furthermore, in contrast with ethnography and action research, conducting a single case study fits in well with the scope of a Master's project; it is not necessary for the subject organization to invest large amounts of resources into the project and time investment of a case study fits in with a short-term project. For these reasons, this thesis project will employ a case study research strategy.  

\subsection{Choice of Research Methods}

Research strategies do not prescribe any concrete ways to generate and analyze data. Specific research methods for data generation and data analysis are needed. 


\paragraph*{Data generation methods}

%%data generation

This thesis employs the use of interviews and document studies for data generation.  Document studies are used as a large amount of data on the structure of the organization being studied is available. Documents are a good source of authoritative, objective, and factual data~\cite{denscombe2010good}, which therefore gives a solid foundation on understanding the studied organization. Interviews were chosen in order to supplement this data with x`information from stakeholders about the organization. Interviews are suited for gaining insight into complex phenomena, which is supportive of our need for an in-depth view of a complex entity that is an organization. Furthermore, interviews are practical for this project as; a) the organization being studied does not need to invest large amounts of time and b) I have physical access to potential interviewees. 

Other common data generation methods are questionnaires and observations. Questionnaires are not particularly suitable for this project as they are most useful when used for specific, straightforward information~\cite{denscombe2010good}. This project, on the other hand, is interested in the complexities of an organization. An observation study would require spending time in an organization in order to directly observe its operations. As this thesis is conducted as an individual project, this is not a feasible activity, due to the size and complexity of an organization.

\paragraph*{Data analysis methods}

After the data has been obtained, it is necessary to analyze it in order to understand the object being studied. Data can be analyzed in either a quantitative or a qualitative manner. Quantitative data analysis is concerned with numeric data, whereas qualitative deals with words and visuals. According to Denscombe ~\cite{denscombe2010good}, some other differences between the approaches are; quantitative research is generally associated with large-scale studies whereas qualitative research is concerned with small-scale studies, and quantitative research is concerned with "specific variables" while qualitative research takes a "holistic perspective". This project follows a qualitative approach because; a) the data being analyzed will composed of words coming from interviews and document studies, b) this is a small-scale study, and c) this project is interested in a holistic perspective on our case study subject.

\section{Application of Method}

This thesis work follows the framework by Johannesson and Perjons~\cite{johannessonPerjons2012} presented above in Section \ref{sec:framework}. The only change to their proposed framework is that the formal ``evaluate artifact'' activity will not be performed. This section will first elaborate on how the different activities will be accomplished and then outline the overall process. 

As suggested in~\cite[Ch. 4]{johannessonPerjons2012}, the IDEF0 notation will be used for visualizing the various activities. In this notation, each activity as an input and output, controls in the form of research strategies and methods, and resources which is the knowledge base for the activity. 

\subsection{Case Study: An Institution of Higher Education in Sweden}
\label{sec:case}

This thesis work will use an institution of higher education in Sweden as an illustrative case study. This case was chosen as an example of a decentralized organization with an \textit{implicit} EA, i.e., there is no formal EA framework used, but as they use IT extensively, some form of implicit architecture must exist. The disadvantage of this is that there is no use of modern EA frameworks in the institution, which weakens the link between the institution and the practice of EA. A second disadvantage of the case is that it is not possible to make any actual changes to the institution, meaning that is only an illustrative case study and as such, a formal evaluation of any created artifacts is not possible. 

As a public institution, many official documents are available on its organizational structure, thus making a document study a viable research method. The documents that formed this study are described in Table~\ref{tab:doc_study}.

\begin{table}  
  \begin{tabular}[c]{| p{\dimexpr 0.4\textwidth-2\tabcolsep} |
                       p{\dimexpr 0.6\textwidth-2\tabcolsep} | }
    \hline
    \textbf{Document} & \textbf{Description} \\
    \hline
    Institution's homepage & Contains descriptions of the different organizational areas of the institution as well its organizational structure \\
    \hline
    Authority delegation documents & These publicly available documents specify authority and delegations of said authority of the institution's organizational units \\
    \hline
    Rule book & The official rule book of the institution detailing rules and decisions that must be followed by the institution \\
    \hline
  \end{tabular}
  \caption{\textbf{Documents forming the document study}}
  \label{tab:doc_study}
\end{table}

Four separate interviews were conducted in order to get a holistic view of the institution. The roles of the interviewees are: deputy department head, head of PhD studies, head of undergrad studies, and head of IT. The interviews were conducted in a semi-structured manner, starting with a set of open-ended questions that promote the interviewees to elaborate on their views. 

\subsection{Research Activities}
\subsubsection*{Explicate problem}

Figure \ref{fig:method_problem} outlines the major components of this activity:
\begin{description}
  \item[Sub-activities] ``Define precisely'', ``motivate problem'' and ``find root causes''~\cite[Ch. 5]{johannessonPerjons2012}
  \item[Input] The initial problem as described in Section \ref{sec:problem}
  \item[Resources] A literature review of the modern EA frameworks TOGAF, Zachman Framework, and FEA. These three frameworks were chosen due to their popularity and extensive available literature.
  \item[Controls] A case study research strategy that will make use of interviews and a document study. The case is detailed in Section \ref{sec:case}. 
  \item[Output] A fully explicated problem, specifically, the set of specific shortcomings of modern EA frameworks when applied to decentralized organizations determined in the ``find root causes'' sub-activity.
\end{description}

The first sub-activity, define precisely, will be accomplished with the use of the literature review. Here, the differences between centralized and decentralized  organizations will be precisely specified in order to show that there is a problem. 

In the second sub-activity, the problem will then be motivated through the use of the case study. To this end, the case will first be shown to be a decentralized organization. For this, a classification for decentralized organizations will be built from the literature review and the case institution will classified with it. Any problems arising from the case institution's implicit EA and their organizational structure can then be used to motivate the problem. 

The third sub-activity, find root causes, will be accomplished through a literature review. An in-depth analysis of each of the three EA frameworks will done to find specific shortcomings; instances where the framework provides support for centralized organizations and not decentralized organizations.

\includegraphics[scale=0.7]{method_problem}
\caption{Explicate problem activity}
\label{fig:method_problem}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection*{Outline artifact and define requirements}

Figure \ref{fig:method_outline} outlines the major components of this activity:
\begin{description}
  \item[Sub-activities] ``Outline artifact'' and ``define requirements''~\cite[Ch. 6]{johannessonPerjons2012}
  \item[Input] The fully explicated problem from the ``explicate problem'' activity
  \item[Resources] Literature study of organizational theory on decentralized organizations
  \item[Controls] None
  \item[Output] Requirements for a decentralized EA
\end{description}

In the first sub-activity ``outline artifact'', the type of artifacts being developed will be specified. 

In the second sub-activity, ``define requirements'', the requirements for the developed artifact will be elicited. This will be based on the fully explicated problem and the literature study on decentralized organizations.

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics[scale=0.7]{method_outline}
\caption{Outline artifact and define requirements activity}
\label{fig:method_outline}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection*{Design and develop artifact}

Figure \ref{fig:method_design} outlines the major components of this activity:
\begin{description}
  \item[Sub-activities] ``Generate'' and ``search and select'' ~\cite[Ch. 7]{johannessonPerjons2012}
  \item[Input]  Requirements for a decentralized EA 
  \item[Resources] Literature study on peer-to-peer architectures
  \item[Controls] None
  \item[Output] Prototype of one artifact for one aspect of an EA framework for decentralized organizations 
\end{description}

In the ``generate'' sub-activity, different potential solutions, each covering a subset of the requirements from the ``outline artifact and define requirements activity'' will be outlined. This requires multiple artifacts as an EA framework is a large entity, composed of a number of different artifacts. In order to develop these artifacts, a literature study on peer-to-peer architectures has been conducted. Principles from peer-to-peer will be taken and applied as the basis for solutions meeting the specified requirements. Peer-to-peer architectures were chosen because they have offered solutions to decentralization in other domains (e.g. technical) and might therefore be able to provide solutions for the practice of EA. 

In the ``search and select'' sub-activity, one of the outlined solutions (from the ``generate'' sub-activity) will be selected and elaborated on to create a prototype of one artifact for an EA framework for decentralized organizations. 

\begin{figure}

\includegraphics[scale=0.7]{method_design}
\caption{Design and develop artifact activity}
\label{fig:method_design}
\end{figure}
  
\subsubsection*{Demonstrate artifact}

Figure \ref{fig:method_demo} outlines the major components of this activity:
\begin{description}
  \item[Sub-activities]  ``Choose or design case'' and ``apply artifact''~\cite[Ch. 8]{johannessonPerjons2012}
  \item[Input]  Prototype of one artifact for one aspect of an EA framework for decentralized organizations
  \item[Resources]  Knowledge on the selected case (institution of higher education in Sweden)
  \item[Controls]  A case study research strategy that will make use of interviews and a document study
  \item[Output] Proof-of-concept artifact for one part of an EA framework prototype
\end{description}

For the ``choose or design case'', an institution of higher education in Sweden has been selected. Details on the case are described in \ref{sec:case}.

In the ``apply artifact'' sub-activity, the artifact will be applied to the case by creating a ``to-be'' architecture for the relevant aspect of the case. This ``to-be'' architecture will be the proof-of-concept artifact for one part of an EA framework prototype

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics[scale=0.7]{method_demo}
\caption{Demonstrate artifact activity}
\label{fig:method_demo}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection*{Evaluate artifact}

The focus of this thesis work is on explicating the problem of decentralization for EA and demonstrating a proof-of-concept of a partial solution. Consequently, the evaluate artifact phase is not done. 

\section{Ethical Considerations}

As the proof-of-concept does not involve any actual implementation, the ethical considerations for this research project are minimal and only involve withholding the identity of the case institution.
