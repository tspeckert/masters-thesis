The findings of this thesis have been used to present a number of concrete suggestions for potential future work that would expand on these findings.

Ideal studies

Not-so-ideal studies that are more realistic

Future Work:

apply model to case and analyze results (ideal, but not feasible)

how peer production (my suggestions) can be implemented in practice (e.g. with something for voting)

find new case meeting some base requirements:
 - exhibits some significant attributes of a decentralized organization (refer to Table \ref{table:org_characteristics} and to \ref{fig:taxonomy})
 - has an EXPLICIT EA

extension requirements
 a) Explicit EA is incompatible with reality (wrt decentralization)
 b) don't have EA, but need to develop
 c) has EA that supports decentralization
