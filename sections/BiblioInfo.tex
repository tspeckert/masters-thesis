\abstracttext{The problem of business-IT alignment is of vital significance for modern enterprises. Solving it allows all components of an enterprise to operate together in a collaborative manner for the purpose of maximizing overall benefit to the enterprise. Enterprise Architecture (EA) is a discipline that aims to solve this problem in a holistic manner from the ground up through proper design. \\ \\
Decentralization of organizations and subsequent change of their management and operation style requires major changes in organization processes and heavily involves the IT. This thesis project uses a combination of a literature study and a case study to demonstrate, however, that EA is primarily aimed at centralized organizational structures, and as such has some shortcomings when being applied to decentralized organizations. Overcoming these deficiencies requires some new principles to be introduced and incorporated into EA knowledge. Relevant sources for these new principles are decentralized organizations, peer-to-peer technologies, and organizational science. All these areas have tackled the problem of decentralization in certain ways. This thesis project presents prevalent decentralization principles and applies them to EA in order to create a prototype for one part of an EA framework that is fully supportive of decentralization. This prototype is shown to be viable through the use of a case study.}
