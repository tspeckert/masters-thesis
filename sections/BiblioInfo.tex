\abstracttext{The problem of business-IT alignment is an important issue for modern organizations. Solving it allows all components of an organization to operate together in a collaborative manner for the purpose of maximizing overall benefit to the enterprise. Enterprise Architecture (EA) is a discipline that aims to solve this problem in a holistic manner from the ground up through proper design. \\ \\
This thesis addresses the problem of a suitable EA for decentralized organizations and seeks to answer the following research question: Do existing EA frameworks need to be extended in order to support decentralized organizations?. A design science research strategy has been followed in combination with  interviews and document studies from a case study for data generation, and a qualitative approach to data analysis. The results of this were: specific shortcomings of the existing EA frameworks of Zachman, FEA, TOGAF with respect to organizational decentralization, based on a literature review; the detailing of mismatches between the case organization's implicit EA and their organizational structure; the elicitation of requirements for a EA artifact addressing these shortcomings; the development of a generic EA artifact for IT governance based on the peer-to-peer principle of \textit{peer production}; and the demonstration of this artifact on the case organization. The artifact takes the form of three guidelines: 1) wilful coordination 2) decentralized authority structure, and 3) peer decision making. An evaluation of the demonstration showed that the proposed artifact offered advantages over traditional EA suggestions due to its improved support of the decentralized properties present in the case organization's organizational structure.}
