\subsection{Iteration 1}

The ideas presented in this thesis work were adapted into two short papers that were submitted to two conferences, PoEM\footnote{\url{http://poem2013.rtu.lv}} 2013 and the TEAR workshop at IEEE EDOC\footnote{\url{http://planet-sl.org/edoc2013/}} 2013: \cite{speckert2013} and \cite{rychkova2013}. The main feedback from these conferences agreed with the problem explication. There was an general agreement that the difference in communication and decision making management between centralized and decentralized organizations required some new governance models in the field of EA. 

%- after I presented some "false" decisions at DSV, some from TEAR; and
%some recent, an agreement was that decentralized environments require
%adequate communication and decision making management, which is not the
%same as for centralized organizations.
%- a set of patterns for IT governance could be established, while then
%there is a need to measure relevant parameters to be able to switch from
%one IT governance pattern to another
%- Back to PoEM, in the
%audience we have kind of strong researchers in EM from Norway, Sweden,
%etc. - nobody neglected the need for "new ways" of governance to fit to
%DEA. One relevant person asked me "will this be a new EA model", and I
%said that intention was to complement exiting ones.

\subsection{Iteration 2}

In order to apply peer production to the case, it is important to understand the current or ``as-is'' situation with the case and to have some context in which to compare the presented solution. This has been accomplished by first outlining the current governance framework (focusing on IT) and by then developing a centralized governance framework. A governance framework based on peer production is then outlined and compared to the as-is and centralized frameworks. 

\subsubsection*{As-Is Governance Framework}

As the main identified issue in case is with decision making, two governance framework's  addressing this issue have been developed; a decentralized framework based on peer production is shown in tables \ref{table:peerGeneralGovernance} and \ref{table:peerITGovernance}, and a centralized framework is shown in tables \ref{table:centralGeneralGovernance} and \ref{table:centralITGovernance}. To give context to this solution, the current or ``as-is'' governance framework is outlined in tables \ref{table:as-isGeneralGovernance} and \ref{table:as-isITGovernance}.
