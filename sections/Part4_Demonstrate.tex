\subsection{Iteration 1}

The ideas presented in this thesis work were adapted into two short papers that were submitted to two conferences, PoEM\footnote{\url{http://poem2013.rtu.lv}} 2013 and the TEAR workshop at IEEE EDOC\footnote{\url{http://planet-sl.org/edoc2013/}} 2013: \cite{speckert2013} and \cite{rychkova2013}. The main feedback from these conferences agreed with the problem explication. There was an general agreement that the difference in communication and decision making management between centralized and decentralized organizations required some new governance models in the field of EA. 

\subsection{Iteration 2}

In order to apply peer production to the case, it is important to understand the current or ``as-is'' situation with the case. It is also important to consider a multiple approaches to solving governance issues present in the case organization in order to have a wider perspective on how to best solve the issues.  For these reasons, multiple governance frameworks have been developed.

The three guidelines which compose the solution artifact are demonstrated through the development of three governance frameworks: an ``as-is'' governance framework reflecting the case organization's current state (tables \ref{table:as-isGeneralGovernance} and \ref{table:as-isITGovernance}); a ``to-be'' centralized governance framework using traditional EA concepts (tables \ref{table:centralGeneralGovernance} and \ref{table:centralITGovernance}); and a ``to-be'' decentralized governance framework where the three guidelines are used for its development (tables \ref{table:peerGeneralGovernance} and \ref{table:peerITGovernance}). Both of the to-be frameworks are aimed at addressing issues in decision making identified in the case organization.
