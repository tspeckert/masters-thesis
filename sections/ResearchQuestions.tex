In order to adequately solve the problem presented in section~\ref{sec:problem}, this thesis will answer two separate research questions. The first question will address the problem of whether or not current Enterprise Architecture methods and frameworks are suitable for use in decentralized environments. The second question addresses the problem of creating an EA framework that is suitable for decentralized environments. Answering these two research questions will enable this thesis to make a contribution the field of EA by providing a basis for how EA can be extended to areas where it is not typically applied. 

The two research questions for this thesis are:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Are current enterprise architecture methodologies and frameworks suitable for application in decentralized environments?
\label{req:1}
\item Are there principals from distributed computing that can also be applied to Enterprise Architecture in order to create an EA framework for decentralized environments?
\label{req:2}
\end{enumerate}
