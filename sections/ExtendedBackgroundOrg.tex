Organizations have traditionally utilized more centralized forms of organizational structure~\cite{pearlson2009}. Of the centralized structures,  hierarchical is perhaps the most well-known and most utilized. 
Hierarchical is characterized by...... [STUFF FROM PEARLSON]

According to Pearlson [AND SOMEONE]~\cite{pearlson2009}, another structure that is highly centralized is the flat type. A flat organizational structure is characterized by having a single (or small number) of people, frequently owners, at the top. The rest of the employees are all below the top level and are equal to one another. This kind of flat structure is effectively a hierarchical structure with only two levels. A common structure for new companies, Pearlson [AND] states that is a centralized from of organizational structure as all the power and decision making authority typically is controlled by the person (or small number of people) at the top. They then tell the rest of the employees what to do. [MAYBE MORE AOBUT FLAT FROM PEARLSON] However, this is not always true for flat organizations, it depends on how they are run. For example, Valve Corporation, a software company in the video game industry released their handbook in 2012~\cite{valveHandbook}. In it, they describe their structure as being flat, but a very different style of flat compared to what is described by Pearlson[AND]. where nobody reports to anyone even though there is a president/founder at the top. Unlike the style of flat organization described by Pearlson[AND], at Valve it is a highly decentralized style. Nobody reports to anyone, and everyone is free to work on whatever they want to. Valve states that the company is "yours to steer", meaning that everyone the power to alter the direction of the company. This difference in what a "flat" organization demonstrates is that it is important to take into account more than simply the structure of a organization, how that structure is implemented is equally important. 


Another common style of organization structure is the matrix structure.

    - reporting structure
    - communication lines
    - standardization (processes and IT)
