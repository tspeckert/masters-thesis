\subsection{Different Forms of Organizational Structure}
\label{org:form}

Organizations have traditionally utilized more centralized forms of organizational structure~\cite{pearlson2009}. Of the centralized structures,  hierarchical is perhaps the most well-known and most utilized.

According to Pearlson and Saunders~\cite{pearlson2009}, another structure that is highly centralized is the flat type. A flat organizational structure is characterized by having a single (or small number) of people, frequently owners, at the top. The rest of the employees are all below the top level and are equal to one another. This kind of flat structure is effectively a hierarchical structure with only two levels. A common structure for new companies, Pearlson and Saunders state that is a centralized from of organizational structure as all the power and decision making authority typically is controlled by the person (or small number of people) at the top. They then tell the rest of the employees what to do. [MAYBE MORE AOBUT FLAT FROM PEARLSON] However, this is not always true for flat organizations, it depends on how they are run. For example, Valve Corporation, a software company in the video game industry released their handbook in 2012~\cite{valveHandbook}. In it, they describe their structure as being flat, but a very different style of flat compared to what is described by Pearlson and Saunders. where nobody reports to anyone even though there is a president/founder at the top. Unlike the style of flat organization described by Pearlson and Saunders, at Valve it is a highly decentralized style. Nobody reports to anyone, and everyone is free to work on whatever they want to. Valve states that the company is "yours to steer", meaning that everyone the power to alter the direction of the company. This difference in what a "flat" organization demonstrates is that it is important to take into account more than simply the structure of a organization, how that structure is implemented is equally important.

Another popular style of organization structure is the matrix organization structure~\cite{pearlson2009}. In this style, individuals are assigned two or more supervisors covering different dimensions of the enterprise. The aim here is to integrate these different dimensions. Pearlson and Saunders state that matrix organization structures are suited for dynamic environments with lots of uncertainty, presumably because their authority structure allows them to cover multiple aspects when making decisions. However, like a hierarchical structure, a matrix structure is a rigid stricture with strictly defined roles, communication lines and decision rights. While there is a more distributed authority structure at the lowest level of management, the upper levels are structure in hierarchical fashion [MAYBE NEED A SOURCE] and remain highly centralized.

In recent years a new type of organizational structure has emerged, called the networked organization structure~\cite{pearlson2009}. A networked structure aims to discard traditional hierarchies in favor of decentralized decision rights and flexible communication networks connecting the entire company~\cite{applegate1988,pearlson2009}.

\subsection{What is a Decentralized Organization?}

As demonstrated in section~\ref{org:form}, whether an enterprise is centralized or decentralized depends on more than simply its structure. Furthermore, enterprises will have elements of both centralization and decentralization in them, meaning that would be an oversimplification to classify an enterprise as just one or another. Consequently, this section will describe a number of organizational characteristics that can be used to determine to what degree an organization is centralized or decentralized. 


definition of decentralized org
    - decision rights/making
        - ability to make change
    - reporting structure
    - communication lines
    - standardization (processes and IT)
    - Dependencies - common (transactions)
    - fluid teams, change at will
    - why the different structures are at different degrees of centralization
