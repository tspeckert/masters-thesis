%\subsubsection*{Generalizability}
The three guidelines presented in section \ref{sec:design_iteration2}; wilful coordination, decentralized authority structure, peer decision making, are, on their own, highly generalizable. These three guidelines should be applicable to organizations other than the case, however no research on this topic was conducted.

% validity, credibility, reliability
%\subsubsection*{Credibility}
There are two main limitations of the thesis which negatively affect the overall credibility of the results and conclusions: The first is a lack of explicit EA in the case, and the second is that the evaluation of the artifact was limited to an argumentative evaluation. These limitations are primarily due to the difficulty in finding a case organization that is both decentralized and implements an explicit EA. 

The EA of the case organization is implicit rather than explicit, i.e. they do not implement an accepted EA framework but they do organize their activities in some manner: their ``implicit EA''. As an implicit EA does not explicitly make use of the concepts EA frameworks, it becomes difficult to draw parallels -- which are therefore very open to interpretation -- between the case's EA and the EA frameworks of TOGAF, Zachman, and FEA.  Furthermore, the validity of the interpretations, and thus the results, may be somewhat negatively affected by this.

The second main limitation of the thesis is that there was no opportunity to apply the presented artifact in practice, thus preventing a formal evaluation of the artifact. The demonstration shows that the artifact is plausible, however the lack of an evaluation makes it difficult to say for certain if the artifact solves the problems identified in section \ref{sec:exproblem}.

Despite these limitations, the findings of this thesis are still interesting as this thesis is part of a research work in its early phases, and as such is exploratory in nature. The ideas presented here have been used to form the basis for two papers that were accepted in two conferences, PoEM\footnote{\url{http://poem2013.rtu.lv}} 2013 and the TEAR workshop at IEEE EDOC\footnote{\url{http://planet-sl.org/edoc2013/}} 2013: \cite{speckert2013} and \cite{rychkova2013}.
