\subsection{The Importance of Collaboration}
The idea that the whole needs to work together to operate in a way that benefits everyone --> still separate entities with independence doing their own thing at the same time as working together when appropriate for mutual benefit.

Caruso, Rogers and Bazerman~\cite{caruso2008boundaries} highlight the importance of information sharing and coordination for decentralized organizations. 
        
\subsection{Challenges}
As decentralized organizations function in a significantly different manner than centralized organizations, they offer a different set of challenges that need to be faced: "~...~the novel and dynamic pressures that create the demand for decentralization in the first place can place organization leaders in considerably less certain, and consequently less commanding, positions."~\cite{caruso2008boundaries} In order to effectively meet these challenges, it is important to first understand what they are. Caruso et al. outline three barriers to collaboration; intergroup bias, group territoriality, and poor negotiation  strategies. Other challenges include.... (communication, planning, maintenance, decision making, change management, budgeting)
