In order to adequately solve the problem presented in section~\ref{sec:problem}, this thesis will answer two research questions. The first question will address the problem of whether or not current Enterprise Architecture methods and frameworks are suitable for use in decentralized environments. The second question addresses the problem of creating an EA framework that is suitable for decentralized environments. Answering these two research questions will enable this thesis to make a contribution the field of EA by providing a basis for how EA can be extended to an area (i.e. decentralized organizations) where, currently, it is not typically applied. 

The two research questions for this thesis are:

\begin{enumerate}
\item What aspects of existing EA frameworks are supportive of decentralized organizations? What aspects are not supportive?
\label{req:1}
\item What are the principals of an EA framework that is supportive of decentralized organizations?
\label{req:2}
\end{enumerate}
