clarified RQs 
clarified layout
removed EI -> not sure how ot make it more related (it isn't)
short paper in ref (there a better way?)
clarified method
removed sentence about not doing an evaluation (this was from before I did the argumentative evaluation and I forgot to delete it)
short introduction to results. Is more needed? (though Im not sure what else to put - I simply follow my method)
Clarifid that Figure 4.1 was developed as part of this thesis work
Clarified 'define precisely' part of the problem
Clarified the caption of Table 4.1 (I think the reviewer just meant that these properties are exhibited by DSV and DSV is therefore centralized)
Clarified decion rights, figure 4.2
clarified evaluation
added case motivation to method
calrified outline
Clarified the reasons for argumentative evaluation
Made centralized advisory group more centralized. --> no voice no more
Mixed makes more sense for advisory group. While there is no direct "power" or authority there, influence is still power after all



todo:
update diagram of outline (method) --> maybe add more about outline in method (see jz feedback)
In Method: check diagrams for "prototype" and change to match text; e.g. Demonstration output
weird uppercasing in my self references



thoughts
not sure how I can link table to artifact better; e.g. I am currently saying which guideline I am using
expand on guidelines? instead of just keywords --> but I do have a description of them...
Reviewer didn't liek the word framework; there a better word?
could enlargen some diagrams
